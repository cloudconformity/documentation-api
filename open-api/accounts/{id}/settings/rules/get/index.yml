summary: Get Rule Settings
description:
  A GET request to this endpoint allows you to get rule settings for all configured rules of the specified account.
  If a rule has never been configured, it will not show up in the resulting data.
  For example, even if our bots run rule RDS-018 for your account hourly, if you have never configured it, it will not be
  part of the data body we send back.
  This endpoint only returns configured rules. If you want to include default rule settings, set `includeDefaults=true` in query parameters.
