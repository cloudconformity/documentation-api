This endpoint allows you to create a new temporary external ID. You need the external ID for registering a new account. We recommend using your organisation's external ID for new account creation, however we still support individual external IDs.

IMPORTANT:

> For security reasons, External IDs created via the API are only valid for one hour. If you do not use it to create an account within the hour, you must generate a new external ID and start over.
