summary: Get list of resources
description:
  This endpoint allows a user with FULL access to get the list of excluded resources due to exceptions that have been configured.
  There is a 10k limit to the maximum number of excluded resources that can be returned.
  Paging will not work for excluded resources higher than this limit.
  To fetch larger numbers, segment your requests using account and/or region filtering.
  On larger organisations, filter requests per account, per region or provider to avoid timeouts.
