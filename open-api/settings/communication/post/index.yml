summary: Create Communication Settings
description: |
  This endpoint is used to create a new one-way communication channel setting. This feature can be used in conjunction with a GET request to copy communication settings from one account to others. An example of this function is provided in the examples folder.

  **IMPORTANT**: Some guidelines about using this endpoint:

  1. Settings are created as long as your inputs are valid. The onus is on you to ensure you don't create settings that are duplicate or too similar in nature.
  2. Each communication setting can be **account-level** OR **organisation-level**
    1. If creating account-level setting, you must have a valid `relationship.account` object.
    2. If creating organisation-level settings you must set `relationship.account.data: null`
    3. Only ADMIN users can create organisation-level settings.
    4. With organisation-level user-based (email & sms) settings, the onus is on you to ensure these users have at least read-only access to all accounts.
